# Chef

## Chef Components
- chef server
	The Chef server acts as a hub for configuration data. The Chef server stores cookbooks, the policies that are applied to nodes, and metadata that describes each registered node that is being managed by the chef-client.
	Nodes use the chef-client to ask the Chef server for configuration details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions.
